# Piscine_CPP
## Project overview

This project was an introduction to C++. It covered the following concepts:

### D00

This first module is an introduction to the new concepts in C++ which are not present in C.

### D01

This module is designed to understand the memory allocation, reference, pointers to members and the usage of the switch in C++.

### D02

This module is designed to understand polymorphism ad-hoc, operator overloads and canonical classes in C++.

### D03

This module is designed to understand Inheritance in C++. 

### D04

This module is designed to understand Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces in C++. 

### D05

This module is designed to understand Try/Catch and Exceptions in C++. 

### D06

This module is designed to understand the different casts in C++. 

### D07

This module is designed to understand templates in C++. 

### D08

This module is designed to understand templated containers, iterators and algorithms in C++.
